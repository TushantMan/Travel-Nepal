	<h1>Frequently Asked Questions</h1>
	<p><h2>WHY SHOULD I VISIT NEPAL?</h2></p>
		<p><h3>Nepal is an enchanting kingdom, nestled in the Himalayas between China and India. For a small territory, the country boasts an uncommonly diverse terrain, including 8 of the world's top 10 highest mountains. Nepali folklore is often illustrated in dance and music and the people are open to sharing their traditions. Although tourism is steadily increasing, Nepal's remote location has kept the culture widely unaffected from outside influences.</h3></p>
		<p><h2>WHAT SHOULD I PACK?</h2></p>
		<p><h3>It all depends on your destination and season of travel. Generally speaking, Nepal is a conservative country. We recommend that travelers not wear clothing that is too short, tight, or revealing. Medium-weight and easy to wash cottons are recommended year-round in the Kathmandu valley. From October to February, we also suggest woolen sweaters, jackets or similar warm outfits. Pack comfortable walking shoes, including sandals and athletic shoes. A head cover may be required for women and men at sacred sites and places of worship. For trekking and adventure itineraries, a list of suggested clothing items and supplies will be provided.</h3></p>
<p><h2>WHEN IS THE BEST TIME TO TRAVEL?</h2></p>
<p><h3>It really depends on your destination, activities and season of travel. Our destination specialists will recommend certain travel times after learning more about your preferences. The favorable months are usually September – November and February – April. The monsoon season is June – August.</h3></p>
<p><h2>What do you hope to see and experience during your trip?</h2></p>
<p><h3>Our destination specialists will make recommendations based on your travel preferences. Most travelers incorporate Kathmandu, Pokhara, and Chitwan National Park. However, many also include adventure activities, including trekking and rafting.</h3></p>
<p><h2>ARE VACCINATIONS REQUIRED?</h2></p>
<p><h3>Immunizations are not required to visit Nepal. (Exception: if you are traveling from an area infected with Yellow Fever, you must have a certificate.) Depending on the season and region of travel, certain vaccinations and/ or medications are suggested and we will recommend preventative measures. We do encourage all travelers to be current on routine immunizations. Also, we recommend the Tetanus and Hepatitis A vaccine. Though still rare, Malaria is increasing in Nepal. The elevation of Kathmandu and places of greater altitude are too high for the species of mosquito that carries malaria. However, when visiting lowland areas, preventive treatment and tropical strength insect repellent is advised.</h3></p>
<p><h2>DO NEPALESE SPEAK ENGLISH?</h2></p>
<p><h3>Nepali is the official language. It has roots in Sanskrit and is written in Devengari script. English is understood by most people in the cities. In the villages, different ethnic groups speak their own languages.</h3></p>
